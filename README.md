# Record Book
Record Book plugin for SportTracks (Desktop). Used to find all of your personal bests! 

Find and track your best performances.  This allows you to rank just about everything all in one easy place.  Things such as fastest mile, most climbing, best 10k time, highest avg HR, and some more obscure 'records' like coldest activity, steepest grade, highest absolute elevation and tons more.

This software was open-sourced after SportTracks desktop was discontinued, and all restrictions have been removed.

## Getting Started
This plugin will add a new View to SportTracks.  To use the plugin select Record Book from the Select View menu.  After playing with the default settings for a bit, go check out the settings page where you can configure exactly what records you want to see, and assign them to different categories (running, cycling, etc.)

### Types of Records:
#### Distance Records
Fastest 1 mile, 5k, 10k, etc.  Activities are searched and this will find your single best mile within each activity.  Add your own custom distances here (400 meter, marathon, etc.), or add new distance categories and associate them with different activity categories (running, cycling, etc.):  For example, fastest 1 mile for cycling, and fastest 1 mile for running.

#### Extreme Records
Find your most extreme conditions.  As the descriptors indicate, Max Temp. encountered during an activity, longest activity (distance or time), etc.  These can also be modified to only apply to particular activity categories, like what's described above.  For example, longest running activity, and a separate 'extreme category' for longest cycling activity.

#### Now/Then Records
These are neat, for example, you raced several years ago and got a personal best (good job!).  That record would show up as #1 at the time or Then, but since you've bested that a few times so Now it's your #6 best.


## Main View
This is the main view of the plugin.  Notice the 3 tabs on the right side of the view in the purple box.  The (shown below) shows best performances over a distance.  Select multiple activities to overlay those performances on the chart below for comparison.

The Now/Then or Where Does It Rank view (shown below) will consolidate your records and show how your performance ranked at the time you actually did it.  Notice in the image below, I had my best 10k time (see bottom row) when I did this activity, it's ranked #1 on the 'Then' table.  Since then however, I have had 2 better performances, so 'Now' it's ranked #3.

### Settings Page / Configuring Record Book:
Here you can configure the records described above.  For instance, you probably don't want your best running mile and best cycling mile compared to one another, that's just not fair :).  Here you can define exactly what is ranked.  Select a record category, then select the activity categories that should be associated with it.  See red arrows below for an example of how to setup a 5k Record for just running.

You can also re-arrange the display order of your records by selecting the record and using the up/down arrows (purple arrows in image below).  This is useful for grouping records together... maybe you like to see all your running records grouped together, and cycling records listed together.
